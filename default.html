			<div class="content">
				<p>
					Flew into Amsterdam for a wedding over a long weekend. The wedding involved riding bicycles through the inner city and dinner on a boat cruise around the harbor.
				</p>
				<p>
					The night ended with Marie and I aggressively making out on the dance floor, impressing the bride's Bosnian aunt with our ferocity. Perhaps her aunt's homemade honey rakia had something to do with it.

					Unlike those with <i>amore</i>, I do a lot of cooking, including frequent waffles for breakfast. My most successful waffle invention combines cheese with broccoli to form a savory treat.

					Profiled here is my mother's mac and cheese recipe, which I once made twice in one week. Needless to say, it is delicious.

					This was my New Years outfit. Nothing like wearing a mask to guarantee a good time.
